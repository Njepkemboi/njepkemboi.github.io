Web design is more than just creating visually appealing websites — it’s about crafting digital experiences that are functional, secure, and user-friendly. A well-designed website balances aesthetic appeal, usability, and performance, ensuring users can interact seamlessly while keeping their data safe.

## Why Security Matters in Web Design
While aesthetics capture attention, security sustains trust. Developers often overlook vulnerabilities during the design phase, which can later lead to serious data breaches. Two common web threats are:
## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): 
Occurs when attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, often through unsanitized input fields.
Prevention Tip: Always validate and sanitize user input before rendering it in the browser.

## SQL Injection:
Happens when attackers manipulate database queries through insecure forms or URL parameters.
Prevention Tip: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to safely handle user data.

By integrating security principles into the design stage, web developers and ethical hackers can build sites that are both beautiful and resilient.
